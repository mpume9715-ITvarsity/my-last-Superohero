        <h2>DID YOU KNOW</h2>
        <p>If you want to see the Marvel and Avengers movies in order as they happened, starting with the World War II-set Captain America: The First Avenger, we’ve listed all 25 MCU movies in chronological order, in one guide!</p>

<p>So while Iron Man, set and released in 2008, can claim the banner as the first of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, within its story, Chris Evans has got Robert Downey Jr. beat. That’s because Evans’ origin story as Captain America in The First Avenger takes action in 1942. There, we’re also first fully introduced to the Tessarect, an energy cube that initializes the Infinity Saga, climaxing in 2019’s Avengers: Endgame.</p>

<p>The next movie set in the timeline is Captain Marvel, the blockbuster with a Blockbuster, set in 1995 with Brie Larson starring as the cosmic Carol Danvers. And then it’s time to hit the start with Iron Man and RDJ’s world-making turn as Tony Stark. From there, follow the rest of the list, into the Night Monkey saga with Spider-Man: Far From Home).</p>

<p>The next MCU movie, Black Widow, will be set between Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. Now’s your time to catch up or experience the MCU in a new way with all 24 Marvel movies in order. Black Widow is set directly after Captain America: Civil War, almost concurrently with Spider-Man: Homecoming. And now Shang-Chi pushes Phase 4 way forward. Now’s your time to catch up or experience the MCU in a new way with all 25 Marvel movies in order. </p>
